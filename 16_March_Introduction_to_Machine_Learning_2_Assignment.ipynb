        "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, but performs poorly on unseen data. This happens when a model learns the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern, leading to a high variance. The consequence of overfitting is that the model may perform well on the training data but poorly on new data, resulting in poor generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data. This results in a high bias, and the model may not perform well on either the training or test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and early stopping. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds and using each fold as a test set while training on the remaining data. This helps to reduce overfitting by testing the model on unseen data. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the objective function, which discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data. Early stopping involves stopping the training of the model when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate underfitting, one can use techniques like feature engineering, increasing model complexity, and collecting more data. Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing ones, which can help the model to better capture the underlying pattern in the data. Increasing the model complexity by adding more layers or neurons can also help to better capture the pattern. Collecting more data can also help to reduce underfitting by providing more examples for the model to learn from."

High bias occurs when a model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

In contrast, low bias occurs when the model is complex enough to capture the underlying pattern in the data.\n",

In contrast, low variance occurs when the model is simple and does not fit the noise in the training data.\n",
